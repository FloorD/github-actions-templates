# Getting Involved
 
Thanks for your interest in the project, we'd love to have you involved! Check out the sections below to find out more about what to do next...
## Adding a New Template

If you have built an integration that connects a 3rd party service to Orbit, we welcome your contribution of an automation template in this project!

For your template to be considered please make sure the following checklist is met:

* [ ] The template is in a sub-folder named for the integration
* [ ] The template has an `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file with clear steps on how to use it
* [ ] The integration uses the following environment variable names for the Orbit credentials: `ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID` and `ORBIT_API_KEY`

Once you are ready, you can open up a new pull request with your contribution and a member of the Orbit team will review it.
## Opening an Issue
 
We always welcome issues, if you've seen something that isn't quite right or you have a suggestion for a new feature, please go ahead and open an issue in this project. Include as much information as you have, it really helps.
 
## Making a Code Change
 
We're always open to pull requests, but these should be small and clearly described so that we can understand what you're trying to do. Feel free to open an issue first and get some discussion going.
 
When you're ready to start coding, fork this repository to your own GitHub account and make your changes in a new branch. Once you're happy, open a pull request and explain what the change is and why you think we should include it in our project.
