Automate community integrations for your Orbit workspace with these GitHub Actions template starter files

![First-time setup: create a GitHub account, create a new GitHub repository, add your Orbit details. Each integration: create a new workflow, copy & paste the provided code, follow and integration-specific instructions.](images/main_flow.png)

# Overview

This repository helps you get up and running with third party integrations to Orbit in a matter of minutes.

Inside this repository are template YAML workflow files you can use to automate **third party integrations** with your Orbit workspace.

**What are 3rd party integrations?**

All Orbit users have access to [built-in integrations](https://orbit.love/integrations/), such as GitHub, Twitter, Slack, and Discord. These built-in integrations can be added and set up from within the Orbit app.

Community-built, or 3rd party integrations, are additional integrations offered by the larger Orbit community. While not officially supported, they offer many opportunities to further extend the utility of the platform.

**What is this repository for?**

Within each subfolder of this repository is a GitHub Actions workflow template file, along with instructions on how to use it. GitHub Actions is a runtime environment provided by GitHub to any GitHub user. You can run applications on GitHub Actions for free on any publicly available (*not private*) repository.
